# Environment variables

* ```LEPTON_KEEP_CONTEXT=true``` to keep a context after the container has exited, debug option.
* ```LEPTON_STRACE=true``` to strace the application launched by the container.
* ```LEPTON_DEBUG_LAUNCH=true``` to wait e.g. for gdb before continuing execution after forking, but before launching the app.
* ```LEPTON_GDB_PORT``` to configure the port used by gdb/lldb.
* ```WAYLAND_DISPLAY``` wayland display socket, used only in 2D app mode.
* ```XDG_RUNTIME_DIR``` used to determine the pulseaudio socket.
* ```ENABLE_VULKAN_VALIDATION_LAYER```, ```ENABLE_VULKAN_FDM_INJECTION_LAYER```, ```ENABLE_VULKAN_GFXRECONSTRUCT_LAYER```, ```ENABLE_VULKAN_RPO_LAYER```, ```ENABLE_VULKAN_RENDERDOC_CAPTURE``` can be used to enable the corresponding vulkan layers.  ```ENABLE_VULKAN_VALIDATION_LAYER_LATE``` will perform validation on the application and any other enabled layers, as opposed to only the output from the application itself.
* ```LEPTON_GFXRECON_*``` envvars are translated to their corresponding ```debug.gfxrecon.*``` Android system properties when the gfxreconstruct layer is enabled. Unprefixed ```GFXRECON_*``` envvars are not considered.
* ```VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS``` can be a colon separated list containing vulkan layer names which should be enabled.
* ```LEPTON_FORCE_SOFTWARE``` mostly for gitlab since gpu rendering is not available there.
* ```LEPTON_NO_CONTEXT``` avoid clearing "baked" app data even if it would otherwise be required or recommended. Use with caution and only during development.

* Various other environment variables like ```SteamAppId```, ```STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH```, etc. are used to configure the launch of a game via steam.
* Even more environment variables like, ```EnableFrameEndMarkers```, ```DisableTimelineSemaphoreWait```, ```HTTP_PROXY``` etc. are passed through to the container/app.

# Marker files:
* ```lepton-show-flatscreen``` inside the application depot can be used to configure an application for 2D launch mode.

Enviroment variables of the form:
```LEPTON_ENV_VARNAME=vale``` are passed through to the app as ```VARNAME=value```.
